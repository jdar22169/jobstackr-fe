# DashJobs

A dashboard for job seekers. Written in JavaScript, DashJobs has an Angular.JS front end and a Node.JS backend. Users are able to organize their job search based on where a job is in their pipeline as well as measure important job search KPIâ€™s
___

## How does it work
DashJob helps job seekers know where a job is in their pipleine with a four list.
* Backlog - jobs to apply to
* Today - jobs to apply to now
* Applied - jobs where application have been submited
* In process - jobs that have activity recored such as an email or phone call.

### Workflow
* Paste a link or press `+` to add a job to your backlog
* Move jobs from your Backlog to your Today list.
* Work from your Today list and apply for jobs
* As you apply use the dropdown to note you applied
* Once you have applied jobs will be on the Applied list
* Work from the Applied list to record and events (email, phone calls) that apply to that job
* Jobs with events will be placed on your In Process list.
